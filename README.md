## API REST w/ CRUD

**Just a CRUD, i'll show you how to execute the code**



 

*~~I made this with postman, tableplus, docker, postgresql, hibernate, spring boot, and the core was all made in java.~~*



first of all you have to make sure you have in the path folder a .env file with the credentials of your respective database, i made a  .env template just to show you how to put your own info, i made this and used docker so if you have one you just have to start the code via terminal using the next commands:

    docker-compose up --build
    

 *and always use the next cmd tu turn off:*

    docker-compose down

  to start the process, spring boot will initialize and the program
 will run, using postman you will be able to use the methods served by
 the api-REST.

>  -  get
>  - post
>  - put
>  - delete
 
 
 **some of them has  a specific method to be modified by id on postman:**
 
>  - get
>  - put
>  - delete

*get also has a method to call the whole database.*
